# Automated-Stroke-Risk-Prediction-using-Balanced-Machine-Learning-Models
This project is referred to as "Healthcare Stroke Risk Prediction using Machine Learning" in my resume.
This project aims to predict the risk of stroke in patients using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes patient health data, including demographic and clinical features, to identify high-risk individuals and assist in early intervention.
